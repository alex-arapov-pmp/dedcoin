**IMPORTANT: Starting August 2024, the `master` branch has become the primary
integration branch and has become unstable. Please check out a tagged version
before compiling production binaries.**

For internationalized documentation, see the index at [doc/intl](doc/intl/README.md).

Dedcoin is a community-driven cryptocurrency that was copied from Dogecoin. The Dedcoin Core software allows anyone to operate a node in the Dedcoin blockchain networks and uses the Scrypt hashing method for Proof of Work. It is adapted from Dogecoin Core and other cryptocurrencies.

For information about the default fees used on the Dedcoin network, please
refer to the [fee recommendation](doc/fee-recommendation.md).

**Website:** [dedcoin.com](https://dedcoin.com)

## Usage üíª

To start your journey with dedcoin Core, see the [installation guide](INSTALL.md) and the [getting started](doc/getting-started.md) tutorial.

The JSON-RPC API provided by dedcoin Core is self-documenting and can be browsed with `dedcoin-cli help`, while detailed information for each command can be viewed with `dedcoin-cli help <command>`. Alternatively, see the [Bitcoin Core documentation](https://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/rpc/) - which implement a similar protocol - to get a browsable version.

### Such ports

dedcoin Core by default uses port `22556` for peer-to-peer communication that
is needed to synchronize the "mainnet" blockchain and stay informed of new
transactions and blocks. Additionally, a JSONRPC port can be opened, which
defaults to port `22555` for mainnet nodes. It is strongly recommended to not
expose RPC ports to the public internet.

| Function | mainnet | testnet | regtest |
| :------- | ------: | ------: | ------: |
| P2P      |   22556 |   44556 |   18444 |
| RPC      |   22555 |   44555 |   18332 |

  which are still under active maintenance. Format: ```<version>-maint```
- **development:** Unstable, contains new code for upcoming releases. Format: ```<version>-dev```
- **archive:** Stable, immutable branches for old versions that no longer change
  because they are no longer maintained.
